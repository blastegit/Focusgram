## Before you begin
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For legal reasons, it is not permitted to modify the Instagram [apk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format) "the file used to run an Android application") and distribute it freely. That's why this guide makes it easy to make these changes yourself.

Nevertheless, it is preferable to have some knowledge of computers to be able to follow and understand. All this so that you can adapt these changes to your own and possibly contribute to improving this repo. Ultimately, the idea is to automate the entire file modification process.

Allow around an hour to make all the changes to the guide.
You will need a computer (Linux or Windows) with internet access and your mobile phone to install the application.

## Step 1 : Downloading files

Let's start by downloading the necessery files : 
- the original Instagram APK [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/#all_versions).
- the java jdk [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
- and the Android command line tools only [here](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only).

Once downloaded, create a folder with the name of your choice and place it wherever you like. Then put in everything you've just downloaded.

## Step 2 : Setting up

Start by running the java jdk installer.
Then create a folder called `android_utils`. Inside, create a new folder called `cmdline-tools` and create a new folder called `latest`.

The tree structure should look like this : `.\android_sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\` extract here the "commandlinetools..." compressed file.

## Step 3 : Decompilation

## Step 4 : Modifications

## Step 5 : Recompilation

## Step 6 : Signature

## Final step : Test
